Welcome to the What's New Andrew repository! This repository contains various resources referenced on my [What's New Andrew YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@whats.new.andrew).

## Contents

I will continue to add items to the repository as I build out more content.  


### [WireGuard Easy VPN Server](https://github.com/WhatsNewAndrew/YouTube/blob/main/docker-compose/wireguard-easy/compose.yml)
This Docker Compose file will allow you to quickly set up your very own WireGuard VPN server.  It includes a simple Admin UI to allow you to manage all your users easily.
