## Contents

I will continue to add items to the repository as I build out more content.  


### [WireGuard Easy VPN Server](https://github.com/WhatsNewAndrew/YouTube/blob/main/docker-compose/wireguard-easy/compose.yml)
This Docker Compose file will allow you to quickly set up your very own WireGuard VPN server.  It includes a simple Admin UI to allow you to manage all your users easily.  These are supporting files for my YouTube video that teaches you how to **[Create Your Own VPN in Minutes!](https://youtu.be/T8DaZSA2JG8?si=Xf8NA4QRD0N0iZzu)**

### [Frigate on a Proxmox LXC!](https://github.com/WhatsNewAndrew/YouTube/tree/main/docker-compose/frigate)
These files are used in my YouTube Step-by-Step tutorial on **[Installing Frigate On A Proxmox LXC Container With A Coral USB Accelerator](https://youtu.be/zKk9dnAp8FM)**
